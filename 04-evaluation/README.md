# Module 4: LLM Evaluation

## Why Evaluate LLMs?

Evaluation is critical for understanding model performance, identifying weaknesses, and making informed decisions about which models or approaches to use in production.

## Types of Evaluation

### 1. Automated Metrics

**Traditional NLP Metrics:**
- **Perplexity**: Measures how well the model predicts text (lower is better)
- **BLEU**: Compares generated text to reference translations
- **ROUGE**: Measures overlap between generated and reference summaries
- **BERTScore**: Uses BERT embeddings for semantic similarity

**Limitations:**
- Don't capture semantic meaning well
- Require reference answers
- Poor correlation with human judgment for open-ended tasks

### 2. Benchmark Datasets

**General Capability Benchmarks:**
| Benchmark | What It Tests | Format |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **MMLU** | Multi-task language understanding | Multiple choice |
| **GSM8K** | Grade school math | Free response |
| **HumanEval** | Code generation | Function completion |
| **BIG-Bench** | Diverse tasks | Various |
| **HellaSwag** | Common sense reasoning | Multiple choice |

**Domain-Specific Benchmarks:**
- **MedQA**: Medical questions
- **LegalBench**: Legal reasoning
- **FinQA**: Financial reasoning
- **SciQ**: Science questions

### 3. Human Evaluation

**What Humans Can Assess:**
- Helpfulness and relevance
- Factual accuracy
- Tone and style appropriateness
- Safety and bias
- Overall quality

**Methods:**
- Side-by-side comparisons (A/B testing)
- Rating scales (1-5 Likert)
- Preference ranking
- Error annotation

### 4. Model-Based Evaluation

Using a stronger LLM to evaluate outputs from another model:

```python
evaluation_prompt = """
Evaluate the following AI response on these criteria:
1. Accuracy: Is the information correct?
2. Relevance: Does it answer the question?
3. Clarity: Is it easy to understand?
4. Completeness: Does it cover all aspects?

Question: {question}
Response: {response}

Rate each criterion 1-5 and provide brief justification.
"""
```

**Popular Evaluation Models:**
- GPT-4 as a judge
- Claude for evaluation
- Specialized evaluators (Prometheus, Auto-Judge)

## Evaluation Frameworks

### 1. RAGAS (RAG Assessment)

Specifically for RAG systems:
- **Faithfulness**: Does the answer follow from the context?
- **Answer Relevance**: How relevant is the answer to the query?
- **Context Precision**: Is relevant information ranked higher?
- **Context Recall**: Did we retrieve all relevant information?

### 2. TruLens

- Track costs, latency, and quality
- Feedback functions for custom metrics
- Integration with major LLM providers

### 3. LangSmith (LangChain)

- Trace execution
- Compare runs
- Annotate and curate datasets
- A/B testing

### 4. Phoenix (Arize AI)

- Observability for LLMs
- Tracing and debugging
- Drift detection

### 5. DeepEval

- Unit tests for LLMs
- Pre-built metrics
- CI/CD integration

## Key Metrics to Track

### For Chatbots/Assistants:
1. **Response Quality**: Helpfulness, accuracy, relevance
2. **Safety**: Toxicity, bias, harmful content
3. **Engagement**: Conversation length, return rate
4. **Task Success**: Did the user accomplish their goal?

### For RAG Systems:
1. **Retrieval Quality**: Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR
2. **Generation Quality**: Faithfulness, answer relevance
3. **End-to-End**: Task success rate, user satisfaction

### For Content Generation:
1. **Coherence**: Logical flow, consistency
2. **Creativity**: Novelty, diversity
3. **Style Adherence**: Matches desired tone/format
4. **Factual Accuracy**: Hallucination rate

## Hands-On Example

See `evaluation_example.py` for practical evaluation code.

## Evaluation Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: What does "good" mean for your use case?
2. **Use Multiple Metrics**: No single metric tells the whole story
3. **Create Golden Datasets**: Curated test cases with known good answers
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Unusual inputs, adversarial examples
5. **Monitor in Production**: Real-world usage may differ from tests
6. **Track Over Time**: Performance can drift as usage patterns change
7. **Include Human Review**: Automated metrics have blind spots

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Only using automated metrics | Add human evaluation |
| Testing on training data | Maintain strict train/test split |
| Ignoring edge cases | Create adversarial test sets |
| One-time evaluation | Continuous monitoring |
| Not tracking baseline | Always compare to a reference |
| Optimizing for metrics | Focus on user outcomes |

## A/B Testing in Production

```
┌─────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Users  │────▶│   Router     │────▶│ Model A  │ (50%)
└─────────┘     │ (Random Split)│    └──────────┘
                │              │    ┌──────────┐
                └──────────────┘────▶│ Model B  │ (50%)
                                     └──────────┘
                                            │
                                            ▼
                                   ┌──────────────┐
                                   │   Compare    │
                                   │   Metrics    │
                                   └──────────────┘
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Statistical significance
- Sample size calculation
- Guardrails for bad models
- Gradual rollouts

## Red Teaming

Systematic testing for vulnerabilities:

1. **Prompt Injection**: Try to bypass safety measures
2. **Jailbreaking**: Attempt to make model ignore constraints
3. **Bias Testing**: Check for unfair treatment
4. **Privacy**: Test for information leakage
5. **Adversarial Examples**: Crafted inputs to cause failures

## Next Steps

After mastering evaluation, move to Module 5: Deployment, where you'll learn how to serve LLMs in production environments.
